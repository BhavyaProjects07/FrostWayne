I am sharing you my Banner.jsx , it's Bg must be glassy black and the content inside it must be light brown , more like gold . now instead of dummy line "Get 20% off..." there should be the actual coupon description added by admin . 











Now I want to add another toggle ( enable size parameters ) in the right side of the page ,  if this toggle enables , then there must enable 6 new options box for diffrent sizes like XS , S , M , L  , XL , XXL along with a tick box which represents availablity of that particular size , I am sharing you
